**Taks 1**: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
This repository contains procedure required in cleaning and preparing raw data for machine learning algorithms commonly designed to address challenges such as missing values, outliers, encoding categorical values,etc.

#**Tasks Performed in the dataset**
<br>-**Data Exploration**<br>
The first step in data preprocessing is to explore the data. This involves listing down the unique values in each feature and finding their lengths.
<br>-**Data Cleaning**<br>
Data cleaning is an essential step in data preprocessing. In this project, missing and inappropriate values are identified and treated by replacing them with mean/median.
<br>-**Outlier Detection**<br>
Duplicate rows are removed, and outliers are identified using boxplots.
<br>-**Data Encoding**<br>
Categorical variables need to be converted into numerical representations to make them suitable for analysis by machine learning algorithms.Label encoding is performed for binary columns and one-hot encoding for multi category columns
